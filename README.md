# Petra - [InDev] ðŸ”´ðŸŸ¢ðŸ”µ

## Requirements

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- PyTorch (`torch`)
- NumPy (`numpy`)
- Matplotlib (`matplotlib`)
- Ultralytics YOLO (`ultralytics`) - YoloV10

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JNX03/Petra.git
   ```
   
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python torch numpy matplotlib ultralytics
   ```

3. Ensure you have the pre-trained YOLO model file `best.pt` in the working directory.

## Usage

### Running the Main Script

1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Petra
   ```

2. Run the main script:<br><br>
   Tesing the AI (original code by Khett)
   ```bash
   python Main.py #For Testing
   ```
   <br>Game
   ```bash
   python GameOb.py #For Game
   ```

### How it Works

- The script captures video input from your webcam.
- It uses a YOLO model to detect objects in real-time.
- A grid is drawn on the video stream to track object movement.
- The speed of objects is calculated to classify performance into three categories: "Low", "Medium", and "High".
- The current classification and the rate of detected objects (`CC/sec`) are displayed on the video stream.
- The peak flow over time is plotted in a separate graph, which updates at regular intervals.

### Controls

- Press `q` to quit the video stream and stop the script.

## Notes

- The script automatically updates the peak flow graph every 10 frames.
- Modify the performance thresholds and other parameters in the script as needed for different use cases.
